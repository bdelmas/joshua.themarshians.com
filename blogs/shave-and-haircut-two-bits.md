<!-- Title: Shave and a Haircut, Two Bits?!? -->

If anyone has bought razor blades lately and not had steam come out of
their ears after looking at the price, I commend you, independently
wealthy person. For me, it's always been a nagging issue. I have a
rough beard and go through a cartridge every 7-10 days.

I spend about $15 per month on blades. I don't spend $15 per month on
all the rest of my personal hygiene. I blame part of this on the
manufacturer. Some of the blades try to tell you when to replace it
and you don't see any instructions about caring for your blade.

Well, no more! I found
[a video about caring for your blade on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyxBfGcHDbM&feature=related). I
haven't tried all of the suggestions, but I do take more care to clean
my blade and use a pair of levi's to clean it up. I'm surprised at how
well just those two things have helped. This is the first time, I've
been able to go a month on a single cartridge and it still appears in
good condition. I'd recommend everyone watch the video and give some
of the tips it a try!
