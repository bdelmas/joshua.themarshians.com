<!-- Title: Go Forth and Read -->
<!-- Tags: go -->

I've been diving into the [Go language](http://golang.org/) at full
speed. A book was recently released called
<em>[Programming in Go](http://qtrac.eu/gobook.html)</em>. If you are
interested in Go and this isn't your first language, I'd definitely
recommend it. It goes much deeper into the language than the examples
online and provides a nice layout for learning and discovery. Not that
I hate reading the package docs, but the book provides it in a more
interesting and concise layout.

Like I said, this shouldn't be your first book for your first language
though. The author starts right into it with examples that are going
to stump you unless you are familiar with another language like
[C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language\)),
[Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language\)), or
[Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language\)). I've
been an engineer for a solid 12 years now and many of the examples
required me to look up reference or the Go documentation to fully
understand.

That being said, this is a great book. One of my favorite parts is the
examples at the end of the chapters. He gives you a working example
and describes what is does and how it does it. Then he asks you to
modify it to add a feature or change a behavior or sometimes even
write a similar app that does something slightly different.

They are like little puzzles and I love puzzles, especially the
programming variety. It is a great teaching tool that I wish more
books used. Most are simply reference manuals and that can get boring
quickly. <em>Programming in Go</em> acts as a reference manual, but also a
self-study guide. I'm all for that!

You can visit the [publishers website](http://qtrac.eu/gobook.html) to
get the book. It's also available on the
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Mark_Summerfield_Programming_in_Go?id=HW-5SZ1HKusC&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImJvb2stSFctNVNaMUhLdXNDIl0.).
