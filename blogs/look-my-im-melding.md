<!-- Title: Look Ma! I'm Melding! -->

Software engineers love their tools. People generally regret asking
questions like "Should I user emacs or vi?" because of the devotion we
put into the tools we use. It's borderline religious. If you aren't on
their side, you are dead to them.

Given that, I still wanted share one of my favorite tools: [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/). Meld
is a visual diff tool. It allows you to compare files and directories
and see what is different about them.

Some may think this is only useful to developers looking for
differences in previous versions of a file, but it also applies to
just about anything anyone wants to compare. I've used it before in
configuration files for some of my favorites games. I can compare
other peoples configurations or changes I made to my own.

It contains all of the features you want in a tool like this, but has
two that should appeal to everyone: it's
[free](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FreeAsInBeer) and it's
[open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source). This means
anyone can use it freely! I know many developers use
[eclipse](http://eclipse.org/) and it works well, but you don't always
need a full blown editor nor want to install
one. [Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/) is popular in
the groups I run with as well, but it's not free! Why pay for
something you can get for free!

Give Meld a try! It's free and easy to
use. [Windows](https://live.gnome.org/Meld/Windows),
[Max OSX](https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/textproc/meld/Portfile),
and
[Linux](http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/meld/1.6/meld-1.6.0.tar.xz)
users welcome!
