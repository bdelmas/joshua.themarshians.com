		<!-- Title: Go App, Do You Read Me? -->

<!-- Author: Joshua Marsh -->

<!-- Tags: rpc,go,linux -->

<!-- Languages: shell,go -->

<p>I am now running a few personal <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> applications
and am working on a Go web application that will eventually be ready
for public consumption. Since Go gives us the ability to act as a
<a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/">FastCGI</a> backend or a
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/">stand alone web application</a>, it
only seems reasonable that in a production system you&rsquo;d want the
ability to use it like any other web server. This includes the ability
to reload the configuration on the fly and start and stop the
application.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d put together an example of how I&rsquo;m doing it right
now. From what I&rsquo;ve been able to gather,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a> seems to be
the best way to interact with your application. If you are wanting to
run the application yourself, you can try it by doing:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">git clone https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc.git
cd go-ipc-with-rpc/servicer
go install  
cd ../greeter  
go install  
cd ..  
emacs greeter.service
# Modify greeter.service to use the path to your GOBIN where the   
# above apps were installed.  
sudo cp greeter.services /etc/systemd/system  
cp config.json /tmp  
</code></pre>

<p>You can then run it and test if like so:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ sudo systemctl start greeter  
$ curl http://localhost:9000  
Howdy Doodie!  
$ emacs /tmp/config.json  
$ sudo systemctl reload greeter  
$ curl http://localhost:9000  
Hey there, partner!  
$ sudo systemctl stop greeter  
$ curl http://localhost:9000  
curl: (7) couldn't connect to host at localhost:9000  
</code></pre>

<p>At a high level there are three parts to the application. The first
part is the web application itself which can be found in the greeter
directory. The second is a helper application that makes RPC calls to
the greeter. It can be found in the servicer directory. Finally, we
have a default configuration for the greeter application and a systemd
service configuration file.</p>

<p>Within the greeter application, I&rsquo;ve divided the code into four
parts. The file
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc/blob/master/greeter/config.go">config.go</a>
manages reading the config file and translating it into a map that the
rest of the application can use. Using a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>
config file makes reading and loading the configuration unbelievably
simple. I also use a <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Mutex">mutex</a> to
protect access to the configuration while it is being reloaded.</p>

<p>The file
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc/blob/master/greeter/main.go">flag.go</a>
just initializes the command line flags for parsing. It isn&rsquo;t really
related to this post, but it was helpful during testing because I
could point to various configuration files. Under normal
circumstances, you&rsquo;d likely have more complex flags or maybe none at
all.</p>

<p>The file
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc/blob/master/greeter/main.go">main.go</a>
contains the main function which starts up the application. It first
parses the command line flags and then reads the configuration
file. It then starts the listener for our web application. Next, we
start the RPC services. We pass the web application&rsquo;s listener to this
function so that the RPC services know which listener to interact
with. Finally, we setup our web server.</p>

<p>The last file in the greeter application is
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc/blob/master/greeter/rpc.go">rpc.go</a>,
which is the meat of what I wanted to talk about. If this looks
foreign to you, don&rsquo;t fret. Go has some great <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">documentation</a> on using
RPC. We create a ServiceHandler struct which will manage all of the
RPC calls. RPC requires a very specific method definition, so even
though we don&rsquo;t use the incoming arguments, they need to be present. I
used an integer for simplicity.</p>

<p>The Stop function checks to see if the listener is available and if so
closes it. This has the net effect of stopping the web application
because the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Serve">http.Serve</a>
function exits when the listener is closed. The Reload function is
equally simple because we need only call the ReadConfig function
again.</p>

<p>The StartRPC function is what sets up the RPC service. You register
objects with the <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">rpc</a> package and
then it takes care of determining which functions meet the criteria of
being exposed. In our case we register a ServiceHandler. We then set
up RPC to handle HTTP requests and open up a port to listen for those
request. Finally, we use the http&rsquo;s Serve function to start accepting
connections to the RPC service.</p>

<p>With that done, we now just need some way to talk to the RPC
service. I wrote a little helper application that does this in the
servicer directory. It is all contained in
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc/blob/master/servicer/servicer.go">servicer.go</a>. First,
it gets our operation from the command line and translates that into
the RPC method we want to call. Next, we create a client RPC
connection with the
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/#DialHTTP">DialHTTP</a> function. We then
use the client to <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/#Client.Call">Call</a> the method we wanted.</p>

<p>Now all that remains is to hook it up into your service manager. I run
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> and use <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd">systemd</a>. If you run
another service manager, you&rsquo;ll have to set up your own configuration
for it. I&rsquo;ve provided a <a href="https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc/blob/master/greeter.service">greeter.service</a> which starts up the greeter
application and uses the servicer to reload and stop the application.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m extremely happy with the outcome. I can see this being a
common pattern and plan to eventually make a package out of it. If for
some reason all my links above weren&rsquo;t enough, here is where I got
most of my information from and my example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">Go&rsquo;s RPC Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">Systemd&rsquo;s Service Configuration Options</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/icub3d/go-ipc-with-rpc">My Completed Example</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>There was some discussion about the security of using RPC. RPC itself
doesn&rsquo;t care about security so that can leave you open to
attack. Obviously a firewall would help solve this. Alternatively, you
can use a named pipe instead of a socket and go&rsquo;s rpc package will use
it just the same.</p>

		<!-- Title: Vim and Go -->

<!-- Author: Joshua Marsh -->

<!-- Tags: vim,go -->

<!-- Languages: shell,go,html -->

<p>I grew up on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>. I love them dearly (I have
the pinky fingers to prove it). I&rsquo;m not so blinded by my faith in them
though that I won&rsquo;t occasionally try new things. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of
good things about <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a> and I&rsquo;ve found myself
connecting to many a servers that have <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
installed but not Emacs. So, I thought I&rsquo;d give them a try.</p>

<p>Of course, my new pet programming language is
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, so I thought I&rsquo;d try and get some basic
functionality for Go working with Vim. I&rsquo;m pleased to say the process
was rather simple, but some of the documentation I found online was
somewhat outdated (the readmes were up to date but hard to find). I
thought I&rsquo;d share what I did, if nothing else so I can remember if I
ever have to do it again.</p>

<p>First, if you are like me and don&rsquo;t have Vim installed on your system,
you should get that setup. On
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, you can:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">sudo pacman -S gvim
</code></pre>

<p>This will install the GUI version of Vim as well as the console
version. Next, you&rsquo;ll want to update your <em>~/.vimrc</em> file to use Go&rsquo;s
Vim tools. They come standard with the installation, you just need to
setup Vim to use them. Append the following to your <em>~/.vimrc</em> file:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">set rtp+=$GOROOT/misc/vim
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll want to replace <em>$GOROOT</em> with the path to Go&rsquo;s share items (in
Arch Linux, it is <em>/usr/share/go</em>). This will give you fairly useful
features like syntax highlighting proper indentation, and
documentation.</p>

<p><img src="img/vim-godoc.png" alt="vim an godoc" />
</p>

<p>I was also interested in auto-completion as I use it quite often in
Emacs. Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/nsf/gocode">Gocode</a> provides
functionality for vim as well. Setting it up was simple. If you
haven&rsquo;t used Gocode before, you&rsquo;ll need to install it&rsquo;s daemon:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have your <em>$GOPATH*s bin folder in your path, you&rsquo;ll need
to add that. My *.zshrc</em> file has these lines that do just that:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
export GOBIN="${GOPATH}/bin"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GOBIN}"
</code></pre>

<p>With those steps completed, run the setup script provided:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nsf/gocode/vim
./update.bash
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, append the following to your <em>~/.vimrc</em>:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">filetype plugin on
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you are typing a command and aren&rsquo;t quite sure what should
come next or want to see what the function parameters are, simply use
&lt;C-x&gt;&lt;C-o&gt; and Gocode will give you a list of possibly completion
commands. If you install packages, it will even auto-complete from
those (assuming they are in your <em>$GOPATH/pkg</em> directory).</p>

<p><img src="img/gocode.png" alt="gocode" />
</p>

<p>So far, I have been impressed with how Vim and Go interact. It was
fairly simple to setup considering I haven&rsquo;t ever used Vim except for
the most basic viewing and editing. I&rsquo;m not ready to leave Emacs just
yet, but Vim and Go have certainly been fun and I&rsquo;ll keep at it for a
while to see how close I can get to my keyboard-fu with Emacs.</p>

<p>If you have other cool things you are doing with Vim and Go that you
think would impress me, let me know! I&rsquo;m still new to Vim, so I&rsquo;d love
any feedback.</p>

		<h1>Private Git Repos And Go</h1>

		<!-- Title: Private Git Repos And Go -->

<!-- Author: Joshua Marsh -->

<!-- Tags: git,go -->

<!-- Languages: shell,go,html,php -->

<p>I spent a little bit of time this weekend tinkering on a small project
I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for quite a while. Google&rsquo;s new(ish) language
Go seemed like a good candidate for the project. One of the great
features of <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> is that your can import external
code sources relatively easily. I have a small private repository at
home and I wanted to simplify the process of importing the code and
maintaining the repositories. In the end, I chose
<a href="https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite">Gitolite</a> +
<a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb">Gitweb</a> on an
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a> Linux system. Here is how I did it.</p>

<h2>Preparations</h2>

<p>Since we are using git, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure you have that
installed. We will also be using
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache httpd</a> for gitweb and to facilitate
go&rsquo;s remote import mechanism. On an Arch Linux system, you can do that
in a terminal with:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">pacman -S git apache  
</code></pre>

<p>The git package will create a git user that we will use during this
process. The user needs a little help though. As root:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">usermod -d /srv/git git
passwd -d git
</code></pre>

<p>We are simply telling the system that the users home directory should
be <em>/srv/git</em> and it should not have a password (i.e. can&rsquo;t log
in). Make the home directory and give it the proper permissions:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">mkdir /srv/git
chown git.git /srv/git
chmod 750 /srv/git
</code></pre>

<p>We also want the http user to be in the git group so that gitweb can
read files from <em>/srv/git</em> and then restart httpd. You can do this by
running the following commands:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">usermod -a -G git http
systemctl restart httpd.service
</code></pre>

<p>From this point on, I&rsquo;ll presume you are using the git user and are in
his <em>$HOME</em> directory unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h2>Gitolite</h2>

<p>Gitolite is a great git repository management tool that is used by
quite a few high profile project (e.g. the
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/">Linux kernel</a>). The big advantages it has
over using the standard git tools like
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-daemon.html">git-daemon</a>
or
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-http-backend.html">git-http-backend</a>
is that it is extremely simple to use and you can manage it remotely
once it is setup.</p>

<p>I simply pull the latest from <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and do the
install:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
mkdir $HOME/bin
gitolite/install -ln
</code></pre>

<p>Gitolite uses SSH for authentication via public keys. As such, you&rsquo;ll
want to have your public key somewhere on the system. I copied mine to
<em>/tmp/username.pub</em>. Make sure your file&rsquo;s base name is the name of the
user you plan to log in with when accessing the repositories. Then run
the setup:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">bin/gitolite setup /tmp/username.pub
</code></pre>

<p>I made a few changes in <em>$HOME/.gitolite.rc</em> to facilitate httpd being
able to access the repositories. Modify the <em>UMASK</em> and
<em>GIT_CONFIG_KEYS</em> to:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">UMASK           => 0027,
GIT_CONFIG_KEYS => 'gitweb\.(owner|description|category)*',
</code></pre>

<p>This will give the git group the ability to read the repositories and allow the gitolite configuration file to store some basic gitweb configuration options. Finally, make sure that the repositories path is accessible by the git group:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">chmod g+rx repositories
</code></pre>

<p>Gitolite is ready to use! You configure it and setup repositories by cloning the gitolite-admin repository:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">git clone git@git.hostname.com:gitolite-admin
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my <em>conf/gitolite.conf</em> file:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">@webs = config testing

repo gitolite-admin
    RW+     =   jmarsh

repo config
    RW+     =   jmarsh
  config gitweb.owner = joshua@themarshians.com
  config gitweb.description = A recursive JSON config parser.

repo testing
    RW+     =   @all
  config gitweb.owner = joshua@themarshians.com
  config gitweb.description = A test playground for connection and gitolite.

repo @webs
  R       =   gitweb
</code></pre>

<p>I setup the <em>@webs</em> group to allow gitolite to manage the projects
list. The user <em>gitweb</em> is a special user for gitolite. Any repository
that givea that user read (R) permissions will be added to the file
<em>$HOME/projects.list</em>. Gitweb can then use this file to display the
repositories you want visible. Any repositories that you want gitweb
to display simply need to be added to the <em>@webs</em> group. You can see
Gitolite&rsquo;s documentation for more information on what the rest of the
configurations mean.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied with your configurations, commit the changes
and push it back to the server. Gitolite will do the rest, including
creating new repositories as necessary. Remember, gitolite will use
the SSH public key you gave it for authentication, so make sure you
are pushing from a system that has the corresponding private key.</p>

<h2>Gitweb</h2>

<p>Gitweb comes with git and is fairly easy to setup. I decided to use
Apache httpd (mostly because I&rsquo;m more familiar with it) which adds a
few steps, but it is still relatively simple. You&rsquo;ll need to edit the
following configuration files and restart httpd as root. I&rsquo;m presuming
you have a fresh install of httpd, so let&rsquo;s add a virtual host. Find
the line below in <em>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</em> and uncomment it:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Now edit <em>/etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</em> and add the virtual
host at the end of the file:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell"><VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName    gitserver
    ServerAlias   git.hostname.com
    DocumentRoot  /srv/http/gitweb
    SetEnv        GITWEB_CONFIG   /etc/conf.d/git-web.conf
    <Directory /srv/http/gitweb>
            Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
        AddHandler cgi-script cgi
        DirectoryIndex gitweb.cgi
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule ^.* /gitweb.cgi/$0 [L,PT]
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
</code></pre>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t using an Arch Linux package of httpd, you may need to
figure out the right place to add your virtual host, but the virtual
host information should work as is. We are basically using the gitweb
script as a CGI script. Since we are using <em>/srv/http/gitweb</em> as the
base directory, we&rsquo;ll want to symlink that to gitweb&rsquo;s working
directory:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">ln -s /usr/share/gitweb /srv/http/gitweb
</code></pre>

<p>Next, restart httpd:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">systemctl restart httpd.service
</code></pre>

<p>With that done, we only need to modify gitweb&rsquo;s configuration file
<em>/etc/conf.d/git-web.conf</em>. Here is what mine looks like:</p>

<pre><code data-language="php">our $git_temp = "/tmp";
our $site_name = "git repos";
our $projectroot = "/srv/git/repositories";
our $projects_list = "/srv/git/projects.list";

$feature{'highlight'}{'default'} = [1];

@git_base_url_list = ( "ssh://git\@git.hostname.com" );


# We want to append the path request from the go get which we can get
# from the REQUEST_URI
$go_repo_path = $ENV{'REQUEST_URI'};
$go_repo_path =~ s/\?.*//g;
$go_prefix = $go_repo_path;
if ($go_repo_path !~ m/\.git$/ && $go_repo_path !~ m/\/$/) { $go_repo_path .= ".git"; }
our $site_html_head_string = "";
</code></pre>

<p>The first half of the file is fairly common gitweb configuring. Note
that we set the <em>$projects_list</em> to be the <em>projects.list</em> file that
Gitolite is generating. The magic for Go happens in the last half of
the file. Go can pull from external version control systems (VCS), but
the format seemed bulky to me. Originally, I had to use an import
similar to:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">import "git.hostname.com/git/testing.git/package"
</code></pre>

<p>The addition of the meta tag to Gitweb&rsquo;s pages made it possible to
import with something much more readable and more akin to importing
from a public repository like GitHub.</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">import "git.hostname.com/testing/package"
</code></pre>

<p>The Perl code essentially uses some regular expressions to generate a
meta tag that Go&rsquo;s remote pulling feature will recognize. In order for
it to work seamlessly Go needs the meta tag to include the exact path
being imported to map to an exact repository. We can get that
information from the <em>REQUEST_URI</em> that Go sends Gitweb. So, in my
example import above, the meta tag would end up looking something
like:</p>

<pre><code data-language="html"><meta name="go-import" content="git.hostname.com/testing git ssh://git\@git.hostname.com/testing.git\"></meta>
</code></pre>

<h2>It Works!</h2>

<p>With that done, Gitweb is now setup to work well with Go&rsquo;s remote import feature. I can run something like</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">go get git.hostname.com/config
</code></pre>

<p>to get the package, or simply import that in other code and Go will
fetch it for me.</p>

<p>All of this came together after a lot of searching on the
internet. Here are some links I used to get this all working:</p>
