		<!-- Title: Hosting Your Own Godoc -->

<!-- Author: Joshua Marsh -->

<!-- Description: I sometimes find it useful to host my own version of golang.org. Let's learn how to do that. -->

<!-- Tags: linux,go,arch  -->

<p>One of the biggest reasons to use <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> is its
great tooling. <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/godoc/">Godoc</a> is one of those
tools and it makes documentation so simple that you&rsquo;ll be wanting to
document your code instead of dreading it. Besides having a command
line interface for displaying documentation, it can also start an HTTP
Server. <a href="http://golang.org/">Golang.org</a> is a public version of this
for the standard packages. <a href="http://godoc.org/">GoDoc</a> does a similar
thing for public packages.</p>

<p>I have some private repositories though that I host internally and
I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be able to view the package documentation. There
are at least a couple of ways to accomplish this. First, if you simply
want to host it your local machine, godoc can do that for you:</p>

<pre><code>$ godoc -http=:6060
</code></pre>

<p>This will create an HTTP web server that listens on port <em>6060</em> and
serves up the standard documentation as well as anything in your
<em>GOPATH</em>.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do though is have it run on the server
that&rsquo;s hosting all my repositories. I finally spent some time getting
this working and it turns out to be quite simple. Since the HTTP
Server is already built, we just need a way to get the system to
recognize it as a service. I use
<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> and
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a> is the
default service manager. If you use something else, I&rsquo;m guessing this
should translate fairly easily to the other services.</p>

<p>Since systemd can manage starting and stopping services using signals,
we really just need to tell systemd how to start up the godoc
server. Here is the
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/godoc-systemd/blob/master/godoc.service">godoc.service</a>
file in full:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Go Documentation
Wants=network.target

[Service]
Environment=GOPATH=/srv/go/ GOROOT=/usr/lib/go/
ExecStart=/usr/bin/godoc -index -http=:6060
RestartSec=30
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre>

<p>The meat of the configuration is <em>ExecStart</em>. It is simply a call to
godoc with the <em>-http</em> parameter. I added <em>-index</em> so that the
documentation could be searched. I thought this would be useful since
it&rsquo;s intended to be online full-time.</p>

<p>One thing to note, I set the <em>GOPATH</em> to <em>/srv/go</em>. Since systemd
doesn&rsquo;t otherwise load environment variables, the <em>GOPATH</em> would not
normally be set. You can change that path to your actual <em>GOPATH</em>. I
simply used a symbolic link to my actual go repositories.</p>

<p>Copy your service file to a place where system will recognize it:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo cp godoc.service /etc/systemd/system
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! I now have a fully functional, locally
hosted Go documentation web site. I use it like golang.org, but it
also searches and displays my private packages. I can use it like any
other systemd service:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl enable godoc.service # Start at boot.
$ sudo systemctl {start,stop,restart} godoc.service
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using Arch Linux, I made an
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> package named
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/godoc-systemd/">godoc-systemd</a>. You
can install it like you would any other AUR package:</p>

<pre><code>$ wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go/godoc-systemd/PKGBUILD
$ makepkg
$ sudo pacman -U godoc-systemd-1.0-1-any.pkg.tar.xz
</code></pre>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say enough about how impressed I am with the tooling built for
Go. Godoc is only one of many and it is a good example of how useful,
extendable, and manageable the go tools are.</p>

		<!-- Title: Don't Reinvent the Wheel -->

<!-- Author: Joshua Marsh -->

<!-- Description: After presenting at and attending OpenWest, the best thing I got out of it was, "don't reinvent the wheel." -->

<!-- Tags: linux,go,angularjs,appengine  -->

<p>This last week, I had the opportunity to attend the
<a href="http://www.openwest.org/">OpenWest</a> conference. I can&rsquo;t say enough
about how amazing it was. If you have the opportunity next year to
attend, you should definitely do it! During the conference, I was able
to <a href="http://joind.in/talk/view/8316">present</a> on some of my recent blog
posts. I was also able to attend a session and a keynote from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> and many
other really smart people. I felt like everyone came together with a
common goal of sharing the knowledge they had and learning from the
experience of others.</p>

<p>If I had to list the most important thing I got out of it, it would be
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.&rdquo; As is the case with many hackers, I often
find myself with a chip on my shoulder. I see some open source program
or piece of code and immediately think, &ldquo;I could do it better.&rdquo; The
reality is that while I might be able to do it better, the time and
effort involved in doing it better takes time away from bringing my
own new ideas to fruition.</p>

<p>While there are cases where it&rsquo;s worthwhile to rewrite something
yourself, they definitely should not be a regular part of your
programming. The beauty of open source software is that we can
leverage the work that someone else has already done. This enables us
to make our ideas reality at a faster pace than in the proprietary
world.</p>

<p>The goal of my presentation was to provide a perfect example of
this. By leveraging the work already done by really smart people, I
was able to take an <a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home">idea</a> (albeit a
small one) and have a working concept in just a couple of weekends
worth of work. If I had tried to do the same project without
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> it would have
easily taken months.</p>

<p>In the open source world we have the opportunity to stand on the
shoulders of
giants<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">1</a></sup>. Let&rsquo;s
use that opportunity to our advantage and accelerate the rate of
innovation.</p>

		<!-- Title: Hardcore Google: RESTful Communication With AngularJS -->

<!-- Author: Joshua Marsh -->

<!-- Description: I recently began a project using Go, AngularJS, and Google App Engine. In this installment of a series of blog posts, I describe how to use AngularJS and get it communicating with Go. -->

<!-- Tags: go,appengine,golang,angularjs,google -->

<!-- Languages: go,javascript -->

</ul>

<p>My history with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
goes back almost 15 years. Back then, working in the browser was was
difficult. Eventually tools like <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> came
around and made the work somewhat simpler. It wasn&rsquo;t until I
discovered <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> though that I felt like
JavaScript development had come out of adolescence. AngularJS does a
great job at solving problems that professional engineers often find
clunky with JavaScript &emdash; namely separating the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> from the code that drives it,
properly testing code, and developing rich, dynamic web
applications. What I love about AngularJS as well is that it doesn&rsquo;t
doesn&rsquo;t try to get away from using JavaScript but merely enhance it.</p>

<p>Enough gushing though. If you are new to AngularJS, you can find great
tutorials on their website or you can contact me directly. What I&rsquo;m
interested in talking about today is how AngularJS interacts with web
services, particularly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>ful
web services. In my
<a href="hardcore-google-communicating-go.html">last post</a>, we got
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> to serve our web services. Now we just need
our front end web app to communicate with that service.</p>

<p>AngularJS provides two ways to wire up a back end. The simplest method
is to use the
<a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource.$resource">$resource</a>
service. It provides a simple interface to a web service. If you need
finer grained control though, you can use the
<a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http">$http</a> service. I&rsquo;ll show you
below how to use the <em>$http</em> service because that&rsquo;s what I ended up
going with. If you decide to use the <em>$resource</em> service though, just
keep in mind that it currently always strips the trailing slash wether
you ask it to or not. You&rsquo;ll need to have your
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/">http.Handler</a>s account for that. For
example:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">func fooHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Thanks for the %s!", r.Method)
}

// Handle /foo
http.HandleFunc("/foo", fooHandler)

// Or Handle /foo/
http.HandleFunc("/foo/", fooHandler)
</code></pre>

<p>Before, we go about using the <em>$http</em> service though, we need to talk
about services in general. Like the <em>$http</em> and <em>$resource</em> services
that AngularJS provides, you can create your own. Services are a great
way to decouple code such as connecting to a web service. You can
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mock</a> them when you are
testing the parts of your application that use them and AngularJS will
manage the instantiation and destruction of the services for you. You
can find a complete example of a user defined service in the file
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home/blob/master/dev/js/rest/lists.js">list.js</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the create function. It handles the creation of new
lists or making copies of existing lists. We start by making a <em>POST</em>
using the <em>$http</em> service.</p>

<pre><code data-language="javascript">var promise = $http.post("/rest/list/", data);
</code></pre>

<p>This performs an HTTP POST to the URL <em>&rdquo;/rest/list/&rdquo;</em> with the JSON
data as the content of the POST. There are similar functions for
<em>put</em>, <em>get</em>, and <em>delete</em> that correspond to the HTTP <em>PUT</em>, <em>GET</em>
and <em>DELETE</em> methods. The data could technically be anything. In this
case though, it&rsquo;s a JavaScript object that contains the information
necessary to create the new list. AngularJS will take care of
converting the object into JSON that our Go web service can consume.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises">promise</a> returned allows
you to hook a success and failure function to the asynchronous
response to the request. Here, we call the <em>scall</em> or <em>ecall</em>
functions based on the success or failure of the <em>POST</em>. A similar
thing happens in all the other functions for the service. In the <em>get</em>
function, for example, we do the same thing. The only thing that
differs is that we expect a key for the list being retrieved.</p>

<pre><code data-language="javascript">this.get = function(key, scall, ecall) {
    var promise = $http.get("/rest/list/" + key + "/");
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>You can see an example of using both of these functions and the
service in the
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home/blob/master/dev/js/lists/all.js">all.js</a>
file in the <em>$scope.copy</em> function:</p>

<pre><code data-language="javascript">$scope.copy = function() {
    Lists.get($scope.data.key, function(l) {
        l.Name = $scope.data.name;
        Lists.create(l, function(nl) {
                $location.path('/lists/view/' + nl.Key + '/');
        });
    });
};
</code></pre>

<p>The goal of the <em>copy</em> function is to make a copy of a list with a new
name. We do that by <em>get*ting the list to be copied by its key. If
that succeeds, we change the list name and call the *create</em> function
for that list. If it succeeds, then we redirect to the new list.</p>

<p>I like this function because it shows the simplicity of using
AngularJS&rsquo;s frameworks. I can make two service calls in just a few
lines of code to do something meaningful with the application. It also
exemplifies the notion of &ldquo;going with the flow.&rdquo; Most libraries or
programming languages have a right and wrong way of doing things. If
you do it the right way, you can get a lot of functionality with just
a few lines of code. This makes your code both easier to read and
maintain.</p>
