<p>This post is part of a series <em>Hardcore Google</em>. You can find other
posts here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="hardcore-google-unit-testing.html">Unit Testing App Engine</a></li>
<li><a href="hardcore-google-communicating-go.html">RESTful Web Services In Go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When you first start developing a web application, one of the first
big decision you make after choosing your tool set is how these tools
will interact with each other. For my project, I had already chosen
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> for my back-end,
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> for by front-end, and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> to host
it all. It was just a matter of figuring out how to get Go and
AngularJS to communicate with each other. Fortunately doing that was
stupid-simple.</p>

<p>I chose a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>ful
API for communication because it seemed to be the most organized
method of communication and both sides of the web application support
it quite well. I&rsquo;ve found in my development career that trying to fit
a square peg into a round hole only makes you lose your hair
faster, so REST it was.</p>

<p>Using a RESTful web service means that you&rsquo;ll be managing your data
based on the HTTP method (i.e. GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) and URL. On
the Go side of things, you&rsquo;ll be using the
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/">net/http</a> package to handle the
requests from AngularJS. At a high level, you tell Go to handle a
request like this:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">http.HandleFunc("/bar", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Thanks for the %s!", r.Method)
})
</code></pre>

<p>Here we register a function to handle all requests to <em>/bar</em>. Every
function that handles a request has the same function definition: it
has as its parameters an http.ResponseWriter which is used to write a
response and an http.Request which contains the details of the request
being made. In this case, if we started up this server, and made the
request &ldquo;DELETE /bar&rdquo;, we&rsquo;d receive back &ldquo;Thanks for the DELETE!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hopefully, you can see where this is going. To implement a RESTful API
in Go, you would register handlers for each URL endpoint and then
based on the given method you&rsquo;d perform an operation. We can make this
process even better though by using
<a href="http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux">gorilla/mux</a>. It is a drop in
replacement for Go&rsquo;s http handlers, but it can take care of the details
of routing based on the HTTP method. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">m := mux.NewRouter()

// Get all lists.
m.HandleFunc("/", GetAllLists).Methods("GET")

// Make a new list.
m.HandleFunc("/", PostList).Methods("POST")

// Singe list operations.
m.HandleFunc("/{key}/", GetList).Methods("GET")
m.HandleFunc("/{key}/", PutList).Methods("PUT")
m.HandleFunc("/{key}/", DeleteList).Methods("DELETE")

// Everything else fails.
m.HandleFunc("/{path:.*}", gorca.NotFoundFunc)
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I register handlers for each of the REST methods I&rsquo;m
interested in. In this example, I&rsquo;m registering some functionality for
the list part of my web application. I can either <em>GET</em> all of the
lists or <em>POST</em> a new list at the root (<em>/</em>). If I&rsquo;m given a key
(<em>/{key}/</em>) in the URL, then I&rsquo;m dealing with a specific list. In that
case, I can get the list, update the list, or delete with list with
<em>GET</em>, <em>PUT</em>, and <em>DELETE</em>.</p>

<p>The last <em>HandleFunc</em> acts as a catch all. If the client makes a
request that isn&rsquo;t one explicitly listed, we return a 404 status and a
JSON response with the details. The <em>net/http</em> package already returns
a simple 404, but I wanted to return a JSON response as well. Using
the catch all allows me to send that JSON response. The client can
then present a useful message to the user should something go wrong
instead of a somewhat useless &ldquo;Not Found&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As an example of how the handlers look, the <em>GetAllLists</em> handler
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">// GetAllLists fetches all of the lists.
func GetAllLists(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Create the query.
    c := appengine.NewContext(r)
    q := datastore.NewQuery("List").Order("-LastModified")

    // Fetch the lists. 
    lists := []List{}
    if _, err := q.GetAll(c, &lists); err != nil {
        gorca.LogAndUnexpected(c, w, r, err)
        return
    }

    // Write the lists as JSON.
    gorca.WriteJSON(c, w, r, lists)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the details may be fuzzy if you aren&rsquo;t familiar with App
Engine, but I basically fetch all of the lists from App Engine&rsquo;s
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/go/datastore/">datastore</a>
and then convert it to <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and send that as
the response.</p>

<p>The <em>GetAllLists</em> function is a great example of how Go and App Engine
interact to make development simple. In just a couple of dozen lines
of code, I can create a robust REST web service. I don&rsquo;t have to deal
with <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> connections, user authentication,
or parsing incoming HTTP requests. App Engine and Go do all that for
me. The net result is that I have more readable, testable, and
maintainable code.</p>

<p>You can see how I hooked this all up in more detail in
my application:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home/">Home App</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home/blob/master/rest/rest.go">The Global Handler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home/blob/master/rest/list/muxer.go">The List Handler</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/icub3d/home/tree/master/rest/list">The List Handler Functions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I was truly surprised at how easy this process was. Rigging up a
back-end can be a nightmare. At work, I deal with a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> web service and I am willing
to testify in court that the &rsquo;S&rsquo; (simple) is a lie. With Go, this
isn&rsquo;t the case. It already provides great functionality and the open
source nature of the language means that great packages like
<em>gorilla/mux</em> are there when you want them. Stay tuned, for next
time. I&rsquo;ll talk about getting AngularJS to consume and present the
JSON we are sending back.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series <em>Hardcore Google</em>. You can find other
posts here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="hardcore-google-unit-testing.html">Unit Testing App Engine</a></li>
<li><a href="hardcore-google-communicating-go.html">RESTful Web Services In Go</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I recently began a project using <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>,
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. It is a
personal web site I use at home to help keep my family organized. I&rsquo;ll
talk more about it later in a series of posts. I&rsquo;m not actually
completely finished with it yet, but I thought I&rsquo;d start this series.
Some of the aspects of the project were interesting enough that I
wanted to have a place where I could look back and remember how I did
it. There may also be some people out there that get something out of
it as well.</p>

<p>First, let me explain why I picked Go, AngularJS and Google App
Engine. I&rsquo;m a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself">DIY</a> sort
of guys, and I&rsquo;m always fascinated with trying different things. The
bulk of my work life revolves around <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language">C</a>, and
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>. These are cool languages and I can do
awesome things with them, but they aren&rsquo;t <em>new</em> and <em>exciting</em> to me
anymore.</p>

<p>Go and AngularJS seem to be the new kids on the block that are getting
a lot of attention in my circles. I&rsquo;ve already posted quite a bit
about Go. I haven&rsquo;t done a major project with it yet though, so I
thought this would be a good opportunity. I also recently came across
AngularJS and was impressed with the way it allows you to abstract the
presentation with the application logic. I&rsquo;ve never been more
interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
before.</p>

<p>I wanted to find a place I could host my code for free and not limit
it to a server running in my home. The project would be extremely
useful on the go with my table or phone. App Engine seemed like the
best place for this because I&rsquo;d likely never go over the free daily
quotas. Since Go is supported, it seemed like a good fit in that
respect as well. I already use
<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/enterprise/apps/business/">Google Apps</a>,
so I could manage authentication through that and wouldn&rsquo;t need to
design any of that logic.</p>

<p>And with that, I officially became a Google
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fanboi">fanboi</a> for
this project. I&rsquo;ll talk more about the architecture in another post,
but I used App Engine to server my static content and server my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>ful
interface built in Go. The website, when minified is just one web
page, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file. It communicates to a
simple REST service to retrieve the data it needs for presentation.</p>

<p>One of the problems I ran into quickly was the ability to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit test</a> my code. This
project is a bit more than just a few files, so unit testing was going
to be important. I find that for these large projects if I can write
unit tests I can iteratively develop parts of the system without
needing the others to make sure my code works as expected. Creating
unit tests in go is fairly simple. The
<a href="http://golang.org/cmd/go/">go tool</a> has a test command and the
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/testing/">testing package</a> provides you with
just about everything you need.</p>

<p>Testing code that relies on the <em>appengine</em> package is more difficult
though. You need some sort of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mock object</a> for the
appengine to make any sort of testing possible. I found a package by
<a href="http://bradfitz.com/">Brad Fitzpatrick</a> called
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/gae-go-testing/">gae-go-testing</a>. It was a
bit outdated though and didn&rsquo;t contain all the features I was looking
for. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open source</a> to the
rescue! I forked the repository and got it working. You can see and
use the forked package at
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/appenginetesting">github.com/icub3d/appenginetesting</a>.</p>

<p>The basic premise is to spin up a temporary App Engine instance
locally and then use it with some hooks to simulate typical App Engine
functionality. To use it, you need to already have the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads">App Engine SDK installed</a>. With
that done, we just need to do some minor setup work before we run our
tests:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">export APPENGINE_SDK=/path/to/google_appengine
export PATH=$PATH:$APPENGINE_SDK
cd ~/go/src
ln -s $APPENGINE_SDK/goroot/src/pkg/appengine
ln -s $APPENGINE_SDK/goroot/src/pkg/appengine_internal
go get github.com/icub3d/appenginetesting
</code></pre>

<p>With that done, we should now be able to perform some basic App Engine
functions in our tests. For example:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">// Create mocked context.
c, err := appenginetesting.NewContext(nil)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("initilizing context:", err)
    return
}

// Close the context when we are done.
defer c.Close()

// Get an element from the datastore.
k := datastore.NewKey(c, "Entity", "stringID", 0, nil)
e := ""
if err := datastore.Get(c, k, &e); err != nil {
    fmt.Println("datastore get:", err)
    return
}

// Put an element in the datastore.
if _, err := datastore.Put(c, k, &e); err != nil {
    fmt.Println("datastore put:", err)
    return
}
</code></pre>

<p>We create a new <em>Context</em> using the <em>appenginetesting.NewContext</em>
function. This call spins up a temporary instance of the App Engine
development server. We can then use it like we would a real <em>Context</em>
and perform normal data store queries.</p>

<p>One feature that was missing was the ability to fetch user information
from the <em>Context</em>. Adding it was fairly straight forward. You can use
it&rsquo;s functionality like this:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">// Create mocked context.
c, err := appenginetesting.NewContext(nil)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("initilizing context:", err)
    return
}

// Close the context when we are done.
defer c.Close()

// Log a user in.
c.Login("test@example.com", true)

// Get the user.
u := user.Current(c)
if u == nil {
    fmt.Println("we didn't get a user!")
    return
}

fmt.Println("Email:", u.Email)
fmt.Println("Admin:", u.Admin)
</code></pre>

<p>With all of this setup, it is now extremely simply for me to write
test cases against my App Engine related code. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find
this helpful in your App Engine projects using Go. You can see the
full documentation on
<a href="http://godoc.org/github.com/icub3d/appenginetesting">godoc</a>. There is
still room for improvement, so if you have feature requests, don&rsquo;t
hesitate to enter an issue or make a
<a href="https://github.com/icub3d/appenginetesting/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>

		<!-- Title: Cross Compiling Go Applications -->

<!-- Author: Joshua Marsh -->

<!-- Tags: go,arch -->

<!-- Languages: go,shell -->

<p>In a recent discussion on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/114112804251407510571">Go&rsquo;s Google Plus Community</a>,
some questions came up about cross compiling. In a default
installation of <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>, cross compiling is not
enabled. It only builds to toolchains for your current operating
system and architecture. Since all of my computers are <em>amd64</em>, but
some of the applications I build need to run on <em>i386</em>, I thought I&rsquo;d
share how I go about doing it.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch</a> linux, so I have provided a
package in
<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-cross-compilers-linux/">AUR</a>
for doing this. It makes setup extremely simply. You can install the
package by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go/go-cross-compilers-linux/PKGBUILD
$ makepkg

$ # For amd64
$ sudo pacman -U go-cross-compilers-linux-1.0.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz

$ # For i386
$ sudo pacman -U go-cross-compilers-linux-1.0.3-1-i686.pkg.tar.xz
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the other toolchain is in place, we can make a sample program
to test it out:</p>

<pre><code data-language="go">package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you were building it for your own architecture, something as simple
as the following would work:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ go build main.go
$ ./main
Hello world!
</code></pre>

<p>Building for the other architecture isn&rsquo;t much more difficult. Go will
cross compile other operating systems and architectures based on the
environmental variables <em>GOOS</em> and <em>GOOARCH</em>. In our case, we are
interested in changing <em>GOARCH</em>:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ GOARCH=386 go build main.go
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can copy main over your <em>i386</em> machine and run it! If you were
cross compiling to <em>amd64</em>, you&rsquo;d simply replace <em>386</em> with <em>amd64</em>.</p>

<p>One last interesting tidbit is that if you have a version of
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> that will cross compile, then Go
applications that link to C libraries can also be used (despite what
many people have suggested). In Arch, you can install a cross
compiling version of <em>gcc</em> like this:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ sudo pacman -S gcc-multilib
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, I&rsquo;m going to test a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite3</a>
library, so let&rsquo;s install the 32-bit libraries:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ sudo pacman -S lib32-sqlite
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we let&rsquo;s build a small app with the example from
<a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3">go-sqlite3</a>:</p>

<pre><code data-language="shell">$ go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
$ mkdir testsql
$ cd testsql
$ wget https://raw.github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/master/example/main.go

$ # Test the program locally to make sure it works.
$ go run main.go

$ # Build for i386
GOARCH=386 go build

$ # Verify it's linked against the right libraries (lib32).
$ ldd testsql
    linux-gate.so.1 (0xf77ba000)
    libsqlite3.so.0 => /usr/lib32/libsqlite3.so.0 (0xf76e2000)
    libpthread.so.0 => /usr/lib32/libpthread.so.0 (0xf76c7000)
    libc.so.6 => /usr/lib32/libc.so.6 (0xf7516000)
    libdl.so.2 => /usr/lib32/libdl.so.2 (0xf7511000)
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xf77bb000)

$ # Test is on i386.
scp testsql jmarsh@i386-box:
ssh jmarsh@i386-box
./testsql﻿
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this could all be alleviated by using virtual machines, but
the ability of the go toolchain to do this on a single system is
really powerful. I can&rsquo;t begin to express how useful this is on many
of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on. I&rsquo;m always looking to improve, so if
you can see ways to improve my PKGBUILD file or if you&rsquo;ve found a
simpler way to do something, let me know.</p>
